## ğŸ§¼ğŸ¦™ a kind and tidy CLI for your tasks and habits ğŸ§¹ğŸ¦‹

I've wanted to build a delightful CLI for todo lists and habit tracking for many moons now, this is me finally getting around to it!

## ğŸŒ± features ğŸŒ»

- Multiple task states (todo, in progress, done)
- Vim-like keybindings
- Natural language date parsing for due dates (e.g. `tomorrow`, `next Tuesday`, `in 2 weeks`)
- Habit tracking
- Simple and intuitive UX
- Cute and vibey design

## ğŸŒˆ installation ğŸŒº

- Clone the repo
- `go build -o ~/go/bin/faire`
- `faire`

## ğŸ¦’ roadmap ğŸŒ¼

- [ ] LLM-generated daily agendas
- [ ] CLI commands (as opposed to the current TUI-based interface)
